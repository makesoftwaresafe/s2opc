Tests are covering the following cases:
- Unit tests: cryptographic library and tools used by the stack
- Client/Server simple use case:
  * Client side (stub_client_s2opc):
    > Client requests to open a secure channel with security policy
      Basic256Sha256 and in SignAndEncrypt mode
    > If request is accepted, the client send a GetEndpoints request and
      checks the response received (a server stub will respond with a
      service fault since it does not really implement the service)
  * Server side (stub_server_s2opcs):
    > Server opens an endpoint with security policy Basic256Sha256 and
      in SignAndEncrypt mode and wait for connections from one client
    > On client connection and reception of an open a secure channel
      request, it responds with an open secure channel response and
      keep the secure channel opened
    > On reception of a service request on the opened secure channel
      it responds with default service implementation (service fault)
    > When TCP connection is closed by client it stops.
